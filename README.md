These are my solutions to the 2021 Advent of Code.

All solutions are in JavaScript.

IMPORTANT NOTE 1: ADVENT OF CODE INPUTS

***

I found the inputs challenging for Advent of Code. Thankfully, someone already created a solution and I was able to follow it to easily import and manipulate the test input files. 

* Step 1: copy the input from the appropriate Advent of Code page.
* Step 2: make a file with a name like 'day01.input' in your filetree.
* Step 3: read the file and parse it into a text array using the following two lines of code: 

  ```const readFile = require('fs').readFileSync
  const file = readFile('./day01.input', 'utf-8').split('\n')```
  
* That's it! Now you can easily use your new text array

IMPORTANT NOTE 2: QUOKKA

***

It's pretty important to be able to run your code and see what it does. If you use VSC regularly like I do, the Quokka extension for viewing the results of code is pretty great. There is a free version, and there are other free coderunners as well. I just find Quokka the nicest. Full disclosure, I did buy the 'PRO' version because it was on sale 40% off when I found out about it (30 USD instead of 50 USD). There is a very intuitive interactive tutorial so that you will understand how to use it. Happy coding!
